A Version Control System is a tool you use to track, make, and manage changes to your software code. It's also called source control.

A version control system helps developers store every change they make to a file at different stages so they and their teammates can retrieve those changes at a later time.

There are three types of version control systems, which are:

Local Version Control Systems
Centralized Version Control Systems
Distributed Version Control Systems.

What is a Local Version Control System (LVCS)?
This is a type of version control system that is very common and simple to use. But this method is quite prone to errors and attacks because the files are being stored in your local system.

This means that you might lose the system file or accidentally forget the directory/folder of the file you are working (and then write in another directory).
