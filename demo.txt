A Version Control System is a tool you use to track, make, and manage changes to your software code. It's also called source control.

A version control system helps developers store every change they make to a file at different stages so they and their teammates can retrieve those changes at a later time.

There are three types of version control systems, which are:

Local Version Control Systems
Centralized Version Control Systems
Distributed Version Control Systems.
